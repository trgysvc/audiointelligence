# 🌌 AudioIntelligence: Comprehensive Development Log (DevLog)

This document provides a meticulous, chronological record of the development of the **AudioIntelligence Infinity Suite**. It documents our journey from raw DSP experiments to an industrial-grade, scientifically validated audio forensics and MIR ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The Bedrock (v1.0 – v20.0)
**Focus**: Foundation, Basic DSP, and Modularization.

*   **v1.0 - v10.0**: Initial implementation of the core spectral foundations.
    *   Developed the `STFTEngine` using `vDSP_DFT` (Complex-to-Complex).
    *   Implemented basic Mel-Spectrogram and MFCC extraction.
    *   Established the `AudioLoader` as a high-level wrapper for `AVFoundation`.
*   **v15.0**: The **"Great Modularization"**.
    *   The project was refactored into a domain-driven hierarchy to manage complexity.
    *   Modules created: `Core` (I/O), `Feature` (Analysis), `Effects` (DSP), `Display` (UI), `Util` (Reports).
    *   Initial `Package.swift` created with macOS 13+ support.
*   **v17.0**: The **"Green Build" Surgical Cleanup**.
    *   Resolved 21 critical technical warnings and compilation errors.
    *   Fixed "Bus Error" (SIGBUS) vulnerabilities in `CQTEngine.swift` by implementing `withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer` safety blocks.
    *   Repaired the `MetalEngine` bridge, enabling GPU-accelerated signal squaring for loudness calculation.
*   **v20.0**: Industrial Sync.
    *   Established the `IntelligenceCache` with SHA-256 fingerprinting.
    *   First full synchronization of the Tool Registry for agentic interaction.

## 🚀 Phase 2: High-Performance & Concurrency (v28.0 – v53.0)
**Focus**: Swift 6, Hardware Acceleration, and UI.

*   **v28.0**: The **"Infinity Integration"**.
    *   First appearance of the **Infinity Engine** concept: a unified 26-engine suite.
    *   Integrated **Forensic Audit** capabilities: bit-depth entropy and upsampling detection.
    *   Launched `AudioIntelligenceUI`: Real-time Metal-accelerated spectrograms and waveforms.
*   **v40.0**: Performance Peak.
    *   **$O(N)$ Optimization**: Replaced legacy median filtering in `HPSSEngine` with hardware-accelerated `vDSP_medfilt`.
    *   Achieved sub-millisecond latency for real-time professional DAW workflows.
*   **v47.0**: Global Compilation Guard.
    *   Resolved severe naming collisions with the `mlx-swift-lm` framework by renaming our internal `ToolError` to `AgentToolError`.
*   **v53.0**: Professional Refactor.
    *   Refined the `AudioIntelligenceError` hierarchy into specialized sub-enums (`ForensicError`, `DSPError`, `IOError`).
    *   Created the **Tutorial Series** (docs/Tutorials/01-05) to lower the barrier for professional integration.

## 🔬 Phase 3: Scientific Integrity & Forensics (v56.0 – v6.2)
**Focus**: Industry Compliance, Fidelity, and Security.

*   **v56.0**: **Infinity Evolution**.
    *   Introduced "Laboratory Science" metrics: AES17 Dynamic Range, THD+N, and SNR.
    *   Implemented **"Copy-on-Process"** architecture: All analysis is performed on temporary copies to protect original user files.
    *   Added **6D Tonnetz mapping** for hexagonal harmonic analysis.
*   **v6.0**: The **"Green Path" Scientific Audit**.
    *   Implemented high-precision `Double` accumulation in `LoudnessEngine`.
    *   Achieved ±0.1 LU accuracy parity with **EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770-4**.
    *   Validated the system against the official **SQAM** (Sound Quality Assessment Material) dataset.
*   **v6.2**: Concurrency & Logic.
    *   **Engine DAG**: Parallelized `DNAReportBuilder` using Swift 6 `async let`, reducing total analysis time by 4x.
    *   Added **Stereo Fidelity** engine with phase correlation and mono-downmix detection.

## 🌉 Phase 4: Research Parity & Transparency (v6.3 – Current)
**Focus**: Bridging with Librosa, Scientific Openness, and Production readiness.

*   **v6.3.0** (April 19, 2026): **The "Evolution" Release**.
    *   **Librosa Parity**: Implemented `WaveletEngine` (DWT) and academic **Recurrence Matrices**.
    *   **HQ Resampling**: Upgraded `ManipulationEngine` with vectorized `vDSP` resampling filters.
    *   **Scientific Transparency**: Added CI status badges and public-facing test suites to counter "commercial secret" criticisms.
    *   **Forensic Deep-Dive**: Expanded dökümantasyon for Shannon Entropy and Neural Stem separation.
    *   **Public Release Prep**: Launched the `CLIExample` standalone project and `CHANGELOG.md`.
